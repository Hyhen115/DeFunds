# Crowdfunding-Dapp

A decentralized crowdfunding platform with voting mechanism built with **React**, **Vite**, **web3.js**, **TailwinfCSS**, **Material-UI**, **Boostrap** and **Ethereum**, **Solidity**. Users can create and fund campaigns using Ether, with campaign images uploaded via **Cloudinary**. Smart contracts (`Crowdfund` and `CrowdfundFactory`) manage campaign logic, ensuring transparency and security.
